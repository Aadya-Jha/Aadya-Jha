# üëã Hi there, I'm Aadya 
#### Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer with a love for technology and coding. 

# üí´ About Me:
Hi, I‚Äôm Aadya ‚Äî a computer science student with a growing interest in full-stack web development.  

I‚Äôve been working with React on the frontend and recently started building out backend projects using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I'm focused on learning by building ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a new feature, a mini project, or figuring out how everything connects behind the scenes.

Right now, I‚Äôm working on strengthening my backend skills and getting more hands-on with real-world projects. I'm also slowly diving into things like APIs, authentication, and how databases actually work.

Open to collaboration, always up for learning something new.

Outside of code, you‚Äôll probably find me tweaking UIs, fighting with bugs, or staring at VS Code wondering what broke this time.
